# LeetMMO
Plugin for LeetMMO Spigot Plugin

A new take on Minecraft MMO

Our plan is to implement a class based combat system, along with a set of universal or core skill trees which all players can level up.

Skill points are divided into normal and class skill points and exp gains for each are also in separate experience pools.

Currently being developed for Spigot v 1.16+ but our timeline is currently unknown.
